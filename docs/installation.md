# Installation

## Installing Nextflow
[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) requires Java 8 or later. You can check the version on your system with the command `java --version`.

Install Nextflow in the current directory by running:
```shell
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```
Put the `nextflow` executable in your `$PATH`, if you want to access it from anywhere. For more details, check out the [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html).

## Installing Vaporware
Clone the [Vaporware repository](http://github.com/mskcc/vaporware):

git clone http://github.com/mskcc/vaporware.git
```

You're now good to go!
