# Troubleshooting

## The Nextflow Process

You can follow the Nextflow process by following what is printed to `stdout`. Additionally, the Nextflow Java process creates a `.nextflow.log` file in the run directory where warnings and errors are logged.

_Note: The last executed call to Nextflow in a given directory will be in the first few lines of `.nextflow.log`._

## Individual Jobs

A job running a single process inside the pipeline can fail due to inadequate resources, which will trigger a re-run with increased resources. For other failures, you need to look inside the `work` directory. In the `.html` reports generated by default (or the `trace.txt` file) in the run directory you will find for each process run its status (`COMPLETED`; `CACHED` if resumed and completed in a prior run; and `FAILED` if an error occured) and a `hash`. The hash indicates the subdirectory in which the process was run (for example `a4/00365e` points to `work/a4/00365e9190eca55907746edeb58f77`). In this directory you find the following files which are useful for troubleshooting:
- `.command.run`: This is the actual script which sets environment variables and runs `.command.sh`, Nextflow submits this to LSF using bsub. You can manually resubmit it by running `bsub < .command.run`.
- `.command.sh`: This contains the command-line calls that are defined in the corresponding process in `pipeline.nf`.
- `.command.log`: Contains `stdout` from the process itself and `bsub`.
- `.command.out`: `stdout` from the process.
- `.command.err`: `stderr` from the process.

Additionally, any files used by the process are symlinked in the work directory, and any intermediate and final output files are also left here.
