# Sub-Workflows

Control over which processes are performed in TEMPO is managed by user-defined sub-workflow specification.  When executing a TEMPO run, the `--workflow` argument is provided, with any combination of sub-workflows indicated by the user. 

Multiple arguments can be provided in quotation marks, for example, to run the SNV and QC workflows, the following workflow argument could be specified as a comma delimited list.

```
(i.e. `--workflows="snv,qc"`)
```

Possible subworkflow arguments are: Possible options are 
* `snv` 
* `sv` 
* `mutsig` 
* `germSNV` 
* `germSV`
* `lohhla`
* `facets`
* `qc`
* `msisensor` 

## Sub-Workflow Processes & Dependencies
Each sub-workflow consists of one or more DSL2 style nextflow modules.  A sub-workflow acts as a wrapper that handles the input/output processing and module execution.  A description of the processes executed by each sub-workflow are provided below.

In some cases, a sub-workflow will require data that is generated by a different sub-workflow as a dependency.  In these events, the required processes will be automatically activated by TEMPO.  For example, output from the `facets` process is required for the `lohhla` sub-workflow to function.  Specifying `workflow="lohhla"` will then automatically enable the facets processes to accomidate the dependency.
